        "1. Write a new data loader which picks a random point in the text to start from and returns 10 consecutive sequences starting from that point onward. \n",
        "    - You should also modify the train and test functions to reset the memory when you reset the sequence.\n",

        "\n",
        "The sampling method that seem to work best was max, which makes intuitive sense as we are finding the maximum proability per character vs. for sample we are trying to creat the most synonomous sentences and with beam its random, both of which make less sense for this type of scenario. \n",

        "I'd say beam search at around 1.4 was the best, as the results were quite funny and made absolutely no sense whatsover (leading to a large laughing fit for a couple minutes between the two of us haha). \n",

        "- What does a temperature of 0 do? What does a temperature of 0<temp<1 do? What does a temperature of 1 do? What does a temperature of above 1 do? What would a negative temperature do (assuming the code allowed for negative temperature)?\n",
        "\n",
        "From an intuitive understanding, I think the temperature helps dictate the similarity level between the activation function at play and a softmax. For example, if the temperature is a 0, we know that the activation function act like a max argument, vs. if a temperature were 1 it is just a softmax. Anything between there is a gradient, with it getting closer to a softmax as we increase the value.  \n",
